# Outlook to Future Developments and Acknowledgements

## Future developments and ideas for software for cooperative games
As previously mentioned the package `CoopGame` does not 
allow for partitions of the player set or for 
communication structures (see e.g. the 
book by Slikker and van den Nouweland [@SlikkerNouweland]).
The authors of this vignette are about to finish to 
smaller R packages by the names of `PartitionGames` and 
`CommunicationGames` for cooperative games with 
partitions of the player set and for cooperative 
games on undirected graphs, respectively. 

Cooperative games on directed networks might be 
the subject of a future R package. 
In this context we refer to the articles by 
Gilles, Owen and van den Brink [@gilles1992games] 
and by Gilles and van den Brink [@van1996axiomatizations] 
on permission structures as well as to the 
article by Gilles and van den Brink on measuring 
domination in directed networks [@van2000measuring].
Chapters 5 and 6 of the book by Gilles [@GillesBook]
provide an excellent insight into this exciting field.

Cooperative games on multigraphs offer another 
of many possible lines of future investigations, 
see e.g. the article by Forlicz, Mercik, 
Stach and Ramsey [@forlicz2018shapley].

Currently, the authors could think of various other 
ideas for software connected to the field of cooperative 
game theory beyond coalition structures, graphs or 
multigraphs. We already mentioned that `CoopGame` is far 
from efficient for computing power indices. A software 
package for efficient and truly powerful computation 
of power indices could be a possible project for the future. 
In this context, the idea of generating functions 
appears to be of paramount importance, see e.g. the 
article by 
Bilbao, Fernandez, Jimenez Losada and 
Lopez [@bilbao2000generating] and the article by 
Alonso-Meijide and Bowles [@alonso2005generating].

Cooperative games in a continuous setting are very 
intriguing. We mention the work by Aumann and 
Shapley on values of non-atomic games [@aumann2015values], 
Owen's multilinear extensions of 
cooperative games [@owen1972multilinear], the 1994 paper 
by Algaba, Bilbao, Fernandez and Jimenez on 
the Lovasz extension (see the article 
by Lovasz [@lovasz1983submodular] from 1983) of
market games [@algaba2004lovasz] 
and Neyman's work on values of games with 
infinitely many players [@neyman2002values] as 
exemplary representatives of this exciting field. 
A publicly available software package for cooperative 
game theory in a continuous setting combining both 
symbolic and numeric computation appears both 
challenging and attractive. 

## Acknowledgements

The R package `CoopGame` started as a software project 
in the Computer Science M.Sc. program at Kempten University 
in March 2015 under the supervision of the first author 
of this vignette. Anna Merkle, Fatma Tokay and Kübra Tokay 
got the ball rolling with their remarkable efforts. 
In a subsequent project Alexandra Tiukkel, Michael März and 
Johannes Anwander, the second 
author of this vignette, made excellent progress.
Later, Daniel Gebele, Franz Müller and Nicole Cyl contributed 
to `CoopGame` as parts of their B.Sc. theses. 
In his M.Sc. thesis [@AnwanderMaster] Johannes Anwander moved 
`CoopGame` significantly closer to the shape of its 
first release on CRAN. So this is also the place for the 
first author to express his deep gratitude to his coauthor 
for all his assistance in making `CoopGame` available to 
the general public via CRAN. 

The wonderful conference SING14, 14th European Meeting 
on Game Theory 2018, in Bayreuth in July 2018 provided the 
first author with a very first opportunity to present 
small parts of 
an unfinished version of `CoopGame` to fellow researchers 
and colleagues in the field of cooperative game theory. 
The package `CoopGame` benefited from detailed discussions 
with Izabella Stach (AGH Krakau), 
Gianfranco Gambarelli (University of Bergamo) and 
Tamás Solymosi (Corvinus University Budapest) during that 
conference.
Tamás also suggested the term weakly constant-sum game and 
provided the first author with a copy of the famous 1967 
technical report by Kopelowitz [@kopelowitz1967computation] on 
computing the nucleolus. 
This is also the place to thank a large number of 
other colleagues, 
too numerous to name them all, 
for expressing their interest in `CoopGame` and for 
making suggestions during that conference.
Finally, this is also the opportunity to apologize 
to any colleagues 
in the field who might 
have been waiting for the release 
of `CoopGame` since July 2018. The process of getting the 
final details right took overly long.

The final thanks of the first author go to his Kempten colleague
Stefan Rieck in the Faculty of Computer Science for 
having hosted `CoopGame` on his Open Project Server 
for four years and, in particular, for having provided 
a subversion server for `CoopGame` until its ultimate 
release on CRAN.
