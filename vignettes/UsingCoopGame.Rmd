abstract: "This document gives a brief and 
concise overview of the various functionalities 
of the package `CoopGame` 
and presents a few use cases. In particular, we 
introduce the capabilities of `CoopGame` to create 
special families of cooperative games, to check 
game properties and to compute set-valued and 
point-valued solutions. We also introduce the 
usage of `CoopGame` for visualizing set-valued and 
point-valued solutions in the case of three or 
four players. We end with a brief outlook to future 
developments. This vignette accompanies version 
0.2.1 of the package `CoopGame`.\n\n**Keywords**: 
Cooperative game theory, bankruptcy games, cost games, 
simple games, unanimity games, weighted voting games,  
game properties, set-valued solution concepts, 
point-valued solution concepts, 
imputation, core, Weber set, Shapley value, 
Banzhaf value, nucleolus, nucleolus derivatives, 
modiclus, Gately point, Tau value, 
power indices."
